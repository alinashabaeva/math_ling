# Random Poset and Lattice Generator (Exercises)

This repository contains a Python script that generates **100 random posets** or **lattices** and **questions with answers** to analyze these structures. It is designed for use in a **Mathematical Methods in Linguistics** class.

## Features

- Generates random posets and lattices.
- Generates questions (and answers) to identify:
  - Whether a structure is a poset or lattice.
  - Greatest lower bounds (GLB) and least upper bounds (LUB).
  - Other key properties of the generated structures.
